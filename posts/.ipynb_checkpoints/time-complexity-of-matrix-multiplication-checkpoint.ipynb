    "\n",
    "This project investigates the time complexity of different matrix multiplication algorithms. The objectives of the project are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* understand and implement the naive, recursive and strassen algorithms for matrix multiplication\n",
    "* run experiments to measure the run-time for each algorithm for different sized $n$\n",
    "* extrapolate from this data to find crossing over points at which one algorithm becomes more efficient than another\n",

    "Companion code for this project is found [on my github](https://github.com/chipfranzen/linalg/blob/master/mat_mul.py).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Algorithm overview and implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "All of these algorithms calculate the dot product of $A$ and $B$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$C = A \\cdot B$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For the sake of simplicity, all inputs are restricted to square matrices of dimensions $n\\times n$, where $n$ is a power of $2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Naive\n",
    "\n",
    "The naive algorithm calculates $C$ by calculating $n^2$ dot products of the rows of $A$ and the columns of $B$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$C_{ij} = \\sum_{k=1}^{n}A_{ik} \\cdot B_{kj}$$\n",

    "\n",
    "### Recursive\n",
    "\n",
    "The recursive algorithm subdivides $A$ and $B$ and calculates $C$ as a set of dot products of these partitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Partition $A$, $B$, and $C$ in to four $n/2 \\times n/2$ matrices:\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### Strassen\n",
    "\n",
    "The Strassen algorithm is also recursive, and also works by subdividing $A$, $B$, and $C$. The key difference is that the Strassen algorithm uses a number of matrix *additions* to reduce the number of *multiplications* for each call.\n",

    "$$\\text{strassen(}A,\\text{ }B) = O(n^{{log}_2 7}) = O(n^{\\approx 2.8})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Comparison\n",
    "\n",
    "The naive algorithm is straightforward to understand and implement. There's also very little overhead for each operation. In contrast, the recursive algorithm is a bit harder to understand, and the indexing is tedious. The recursive algorithm also has quite a bit of overhead, as lots of new matrices have to be created in memory, and the relatively complex `recursive_mat_mul` function has to be called many times, whereas the naive algorithm simply calls `A[i, k] * B[k, j]` over and over.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Strassen algorithm has the most overhead, as 7 new matrices and a variety of matrix additions occur for every call. This means that the coefficients on the terms of the asymtotic complexity are quite high. Consequently, it takes a while for the strassen algorithm to overtake an $O(n^{3})$ function with lower coefficients. This means that the cross over points at which the Strassen algorithm becomes more efficient than the naive or recursive algorithms might be at very large $n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Measuring performance on my machine\n",
    "\n",
    "In the module [mat_mul.py](https://github.com/chipfranzen/linalg/blob/master/mat_mul.py) I provide a function for measuring execution times for different `mat_mul` functions at different $n$. These experiments take a while to run at large $n$, so 64 is the maximum $n$ that I actually tested on my machine. To account for the precision of my machine's clock and variability in execution time, I've averaged 3000 trials for the naive algorithm, and 300 trials for the recursive and Strassen algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "The results (average execution time in seconds):\n",
    "\n",

    "At first, the naive algorithm grows much more slowly than the recursive and Strassen algorithms. In fact, the Strassen algorithm has the worst performance of the \n",
    "three for small $n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Extrapolate to estimate cross-over points\n",
    "\n",
    "By fitting a polynomial regression line to each set of data points, cross-over points can be estimated for these approaches to matrix multiplication.\n",
    "\n",
    "The crossover point for the recursive and strassen algorithms is fairly early, at just $n=32$, and is shown in the experimental data. Finding a crossover point for the naive and strassen algorithms was a little trickier.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fitted regression models have very small coefficients for the $n^3$ and $n^{{log_27}}$ terms. Here is a plot of the models up to $n=1024$:\n",
    "\n",
    "![regression](/images/regressions.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "I timed a `1024 x 1024` multiplication for the naive and strassen methods, and the times (`~17m` and `~45m`, respectively) matched the regression predictions fairly closely. A back of the envelope calculation for a crossover point led to an estimate of around $n=$ `3e14` for the point at which the strassen algorithm outperforms the naive. Obviously, this result was a bit disappointing, as I'd hoped to find that the strassen algorithm caught up to the naive fairly quickly. It seems that Python implementations involve too much overhead to benefit from the lower computational complexity of the strassen algorithm. I tried a couple different versions of the strassen algorithm, but wasn't able to improve execution time this way. Most of the papers that I read on this topic involved code written in C or Java. These researchers were able to find crossover points ranging from $n=450$ to $n=1024$.\n",
